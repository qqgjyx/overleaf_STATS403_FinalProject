# Presentation

This folder/directory includes some basic templates for presentation; they include

- title page settings, including author's information 
- footer setting
- frame layout
- figure insertion
- free list or enumeration

There is a drive file {you shall rename it}  and three
subdirectories/sub-folders (I recommend that you keep them):

- preamble for selecting and including LaTex packages
- figures for image contents, including a subdirectory of author photos
- sections for slide frames, I recommend on file for each slide

## Usage
Copy the template and change the TeX file name & the Makefile variables. Then issue

```
make all
```

To clean intermediate and output files, issue

```
make clean
```
